# Mental-Health-in-Tech-EDA

This project explores the Mental Health in Tech Survey (2014) — a globally recognized dataset focused on assessing mental health prevalence, stigma, and employer support structures within the technology sector. With rising awareness around mental health in the workplace, particularly in high-pressure environments like tech companies and startups, this dataset offers an opportunity to examine real employee experiences and perceptions across regions, company sizes, and job structures.

The dataset contains responses to a detailed questionnaire that covered:

- Mental health history and treatment-seeking behavior <br>
- Family history of mental illness <br>
- Whether respondents work in tech or non-tech companies <br>
- Presence of employer-provided mental health benefits <br>
- Perceived openness to discuss mental health with coworkers and supervisors <br>
- Ease of taking mental health leave <br>
- Observed or experienced consequences for discussing mental health <br>
- Comparison of attitudes toward physical vs mental health <br>

I performed an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) to uncover insights and answer both broad and specific questions, such as: <br>

- How do mental health concerns interfere with work productivity?<br>
- Which factors predict whether someone seeks treatment?<br>
- How comfortable are employees discussing mental health with their peers and supervisors?<br>
- Does company size, remote work, or access to benefits influence mental health outcomes?<br>
- Are there visible differences in mental health openness across countries?<br>
- Is mental health taken as seriously as physical health in the workplace?<br>
Throughout the analysis, I also paid close attention to data cleaning (especially age and gender normalization), feature engineering (company size grouping, binary encoding), and visual storytelling to communicate findings clearly and effectively.

This project is not just about code — it's about connecting data to real-world impact. The insights derived here can guide employers, HR departments, mental health advocates, and policy designers to build more inclusive, transparent, and supportive work environments.

By analyzing a real-world, socially impactful dataset, this project demonstrates the practical application of data analytics skills — from raw data to business-aligned insights — and showcases the role of data-driven decision-making in shaping healthier workplace cultures.
